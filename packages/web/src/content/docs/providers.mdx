description: Connecting to Anthropic.
---

This version uses the Claude SDK and connects exclusively to Anthropic's Claude models.

---

## Anthropic

To use Claude models, you need to authenticate with Anthropic.

---

### Using the TUI

1. Run the `/connect` command in the TUI
2. Select **Anthropic**
3. Choose your authentication method:
   - **Claude Pro/Max**: Sign in with your Anthropic account (uses OAuth)
   - **API Key**: Enter your Anthropic API key

---

### Using Environment Variables

Set your API key in the environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Or pass it when running:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... opencode
```

---

### Credentials Storage

When you authenticate via the TUI, credentials are stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`.

---

## Base URL

You can customize the base URL for Anthropic by setting the `baseURL` option. This is useful when using proxy services or custom endpoints.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
